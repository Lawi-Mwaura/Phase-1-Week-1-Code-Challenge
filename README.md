                           #Phase-1-Week-1-Code-Challenge

#Project Description

This repository contains a series of code challenges designed to assess students' understanding and application of the concepts covered in phase-0 to the first week of phase-1. By testing their knowledge, we aim to evaluate their progress and ensure a strong foundation in HTML and JavaScript.

These challenges not only serve as a form of evaluation but also present real-life problems that students may encounter in their future development endeavors. By solving these challenges, students will gain practical experience and learn how to apply their HTML and JavaScript skills to solve real-world problems.

The challenges cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to form validation, DOM manipulation, and basic algorithms. By working through these challenges, students will strengthen their understanding of solving real world problems.


#Project Setup

This repository contains 3 folders. Each challenge is solved in each folder containing respective Html and Javascript files.
